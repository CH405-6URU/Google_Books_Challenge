# Google_Books_Challenge
My solution to the bookshelf app challenge found here (https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-bookshelf?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.android.com%2Fcourses%2Fpathways%2Fandroid-basics-compose-unit-5-pathway-2%23codelab-https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.android.com%2Fcodelabs%2Fbasic-android-kotlin-compose-bookshelf#0)

It is ineffcient and does not look great but it meets the criteria laid out by the challenge.
